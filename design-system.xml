You are building an Awwwards Site of the Year winner for 2030. This is a premium Enterprise SaaS application named "Sijadin". Every single detail matters. No shortcuts. No templates. No generic solutions.

<company>
Name: Sijadin (Sistem Informasi Perjalanan Dinas)
Tagline: "Seamless Reporting. Beyond Paperwork."
Focus: AI-Assisted Official Travel Reporting Platform & Document Automation
Target Audience: Government Officials (ASN), Corporate Executives, Operational Managers.
Vibe: The Seamless Flow. Frictionless, liquid, ethereal, yet surgically precise.
</company>

<design_philosophy>
The interface must feel like "Oxygen". It removes the weight of bureaucracy. 
Visual Metaphor: Liquid Flow & Clean Glass. 
The transition from a raw receipt to a finalized report should feel like water flowing through a filter—effortless and clarifying.
Avoid "Government App" aesthetics (clunky, gray, dense). 
Embrace "Future Enterprise" aesthetics (Airy, Light, Intelligent).
</design_philosophy>

<color_system>
Forget standard palettes. This is surgical and fresh.
Backgrounds:
- Snow White (Base): #FFFFFF
- Vapor Blue (Surface/Cards): #F0F9FF (Very subtle cool tint)

Accents:
- Deep Sapphire (Primary/Actions): #0F172A (Commands authority, anchors the design)
- Electric Teal (Highlights/AI Active State): #06B6D4 (Represents intelligence/freshness)
- Success Green (Validation): #10B981
- Error Red (Critical): #F43F5E

Glassmorphism Strategy:
- Sidebar & Floating Elements: background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); backdrop-filter: blur(12px); border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
- Shadows: Soft, diffused shadows (0px 10px 40px rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.05)) to create depth without dirtiness.
</color_system>

<typography>
Font Family: 'Geist Sans' or 'Inter Tight'. 
Style: Ultra-Modern & Futuristic.
- Headlines: Light/ExtraLight weight (300). Letter-spacing: -0.02em. Large scale.
- Body: Regular (400). High readability. Color: #334155 (Slate 700).
- Data/Numbers: Monospace (Geist Mono/JetBrains Mono) for financial data.
</typography>

<iconography>
IMPORTANT: DO NOT use Lucide React. It looks too generic.
Library: Phosphor Icons (React).
Weight: 'Light' or 'Thin' to match the typography.
Style: Elegant, sharp lines. No fill unless active.
</iconography>

<cursor_design>
The cursor remains standard (system default) to maintain usability for administrative tasks, BUT:
- All interactive elements (buttons, cards) must have premium micro-interactions on hover.
- Hover Effect: Elements gently lift (transform: translateY(-2px)) and glow subtly (box-shadow).
- Buttons: On click, scale down (0.98) with spring physics.
</cursor_design>

<layout_structure>
1. Dashboard (The Cockpit):
   - Glassmorphism Sidebar (Collapsible).
   - Main Content Area: Spacious, centered max-width for document editing (like Notion/Google Docs but prettier).
   - Floating Action Button (FAB) for "New Report" with a liquid ripple effect.

2. Document Editor (Tiptap):
   - Minimalist toolbar that appears only when text is selected (Bubble Menu).
   - "Focus Mode": Fades out UI elements when typing.
   - AI Suggestions: Appear as floating cards in the margin with #06B6D4 border.
</layout_structure>

<motion_principles>
Library: Framer Motion + Lenis (Smooth Scroll).
Concept: "Liquid Fade".
1. Page Load: Content staggers in from bottom (y: 20) with high damping (stiffness: 100, damping: 20).
2. Modals/Panels: Do not "pop". They "unfold" or slide in with a blur reveal (filter: blur(10px) -> blur(0px)).
3. Progress Indicators: NOT a solid bar. Use a flowing particle stream or a gradient line that pulses.
4. Scroll: Lenis integration is MANDATORY. Scrolling must feel heavy and smooth, not jerky.
</motion_principles>

<core_features_ui>
1. Autonomous Document Extraction (Upload):
   - Dropzone is a large, breathing glass panel.
   - When uploading, show a "Scanning" animation (a laser scan line moving over the file icon).
   - Use Skeleton Screens with a shimmering teal gradient while AI is processing.

2. Context-Aware Draft Engine:
   - Split view or clean document view.
   - AI changes are highlighted in a soft teal background (#CCFBF1).

3. One-Click Compliance (Export):
   - Preview modal shows the "Paper" view (white box with drop shadow).
   - Export buttons (PDF/DOCX) trigger a "success" confetti or checkmark morph animation.
</core_features_ui>

<technical_architecture>
Frontend:
- React + Vite + TypeScript.
- TailwindCSS for styling.
- Framer Motion for animations.
- TanStack Query for state management.
- Tiptap (Headless wrapper) for the rich text editor.

Backend (Contextual Awareness):
- FastAPI (Python).
- Local Storage: MinIO (S3 Compatible) for file handling.
- Database: PostgreSQL + pgvector.
- Job Queue: Redis + RQ/Celery (Async processing for OCR).

Note: Ensure the UI handles "Async States" gracefully. If a job is queued, show a non-blocking toast or status indicator in the corner.
</technical_architecture>

<quality_checklist>
□ Are the icons Phosphor (Light/Thin)? (No generic Lucide).
□ Does the scroll feel smooth (Lenis)?
□ Is the whitespace generous? (Avoid clutter).
□ Do modals use backdrop-blur (Glassmorphism)?
□ Is the primary blue (#0F172A) used for actions and teal (#06B6D4) for AI?
□ Are shadows colored and diffused (not black)?
□ Does the typography feel "Ultra-Thin" and futuristic?
</quality_checklist>

Build this. Make the bureaucracy feel beautiful.
